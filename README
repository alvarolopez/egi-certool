Small tool to make the certification process of a new site less
tedious. This tool will run several tests by itself, namely:

 1.- Query the BDII for the published CEs.
 2.- CE tests:
    2.1.- For the lcg-CE:
        - GridFTP is running
        - globus-job-run directly to the CE.
        - globus-job-run to the fork JM.
        - globus-job-run to the queue

        ...
         
    
Execute 
 ./run_tests.py --help
 
for more details on usage.

NOTICE:

This is not any official tool. It is only a tool to help me with
the preliminary certification tests to join our NGI (NGI_IBERGRID).
Use it at your own risk.
